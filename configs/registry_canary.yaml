# Registry Canary File - INTEGRITY CHECKPOINT
# ============================================
# This file contains ONLY values that cannot be derived from the registry.
# Full method lists live in classification.yaml (single source of truth).
#
# ANTI-CHEAT PURPOSE:
# The verification script cross-checks this file against:
#   1. configs/mlflow_registry/parameters/classification.yaml (source)
#   2. src/data_io/registry.py (constants)
#   3. tests/test_registry.py (test assertions)
# All four files must agree for commits to pass.
#
# To expand the experimental design:
#   1. Update configs/mlflow_registry/parameters/classification.yaml FIRST
#   2. Regenerate this file's checksum: sha256sum <classification.yaml>
#   3. Update expected_counts below
#   4. Update src/data_io/registry.py constants
#   5. Update tests/test_registry.py
#   6. Commit ALL changes together (CI will verify consistency)

# INVALID METHODS - NEGATIVE TEST DATA
# These must NEVER appear in extracted data. If any script produces these,
# the data is BROKEN. This list is UNIQUE to the canary (not in registry).
