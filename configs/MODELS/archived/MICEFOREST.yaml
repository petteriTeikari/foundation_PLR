    LIST:
      # List as in you have now just 3 hyperparameters, not 3^5=243 combinations as you would have with a grid search
      # i.e. the last values are the defaults, and we see if can make the network slightly narrower and still get
      # decent results? These are not obviously the only combos you could try, but the main focus of the paper was
      # recent foundational models, and maybe these hyperparams give you an idea what the off-the-shelf models
      # can do without too much tweaking
