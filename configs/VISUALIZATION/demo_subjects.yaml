# Demo Subjects Configuration for Foundation PLR Manuscript
# Created: 2026-01-21
# Purpose: Reproducible subject selection for individual-level plots
#
# Selection Criteria:
# - 6 Control + 6 Glaucoma subjects
# - Distributed across outlier percentage: high (challenging), average, low (easy)
# - IMPORTANT: Avoid cherry-picking easy cases - include challenging subjects!
# - Mix of train/test splits for variety

# Statistics from subject selection

  # Key observation: Glaucoma has higher median outlier % than controls
  # This supports the hypothesis that glaucoma affects signal quality
