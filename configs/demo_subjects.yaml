# Demo Subjects Configuration
# ============================
# 8 subjects selected for individual PLR trace visualization
# Stratified by: diagnosis (healthy/glaucoma) x outlier percentage (low/high)
#
# NOTE: Subject codes are re-anonymized (Hxxx for healthy, Gxxx for glaucoma)
# The private lookup table (data/private/subject_lookup.yaml) maps to original codes
