# User Prompt - Lay Professional Figure Coverage Plan

**Saved verbatim from user input:**

---

Could we next create /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/foundation-PLR/foundation_PLR/docs/repo-figures/layprofessional-figure-coverage-plan.md on how these could be relevant for people outside biomedical research. We should be academically honest how garbage or suboptimal the propsoed forecasting models have been (e.g. /home/petteri/Dropbox/KnowledgeBase/Time Series/Deep - Time Series - Forecasting.md), and we don't want to come across as forecasting snakeoil lifestyle entrepreneurs spending their time at Soho House enjoying their imagined value :D So let's tryo to frame these as data quality issues for other field as well? The problem now is that not many fields outside biomedical research, electrophyisiology, engineering and sound/music has that dense timeseries that require this type of use of TSFM. We can think of user personas here to think how these could work or not in other domains. 1) You are working in food logistics, or humanitarian field, e.g. at UN's World Food Programme and you might have some inventory updates let's say once a day which is wildly different scale from our 30 Hz signal. You most likely in that case you have multivariate time series combined with freeform text? Your whole definition of artifact is very different? You can obviously push your multivariate time-series through some model, but you probably want to condition these observed values with some events or "external knowledge"? As in why was there a glitch someday with your data? Was there a missile strike in Kyiv that day causing an anomaly? In that case you probably are very happy with this GMAN type of approach /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/biblio/biblio-pupil/bechler-speicher-2025-graph-mixing-additive-networks.md (see /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/foundationPLR/discussion.tex and /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/mcp-review/submissions/preprint/v2-Jan13-2026/ai-passport-v2-8-3-SSRN.tex)? 2) Maybe you work in e-commerce and you want to predict some market demand? E.g. what is your concept of artifact there? You probably want to include some seasonal, weekly, etc. priors to your model? Demand for certain items on your food store might be very different on weekdays? on special Holidays? You would never impute even in this case? /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/biblio/biblio-pupil/mctavish-2024-mgam-interpretable-gam-missing-values.md ? We could acknowledge these limtiations in cases where we either have very sparse time series (also true for EHRs), and no desire even to impute/reconstruct data. We could then devote some figures for engineering? 3) You could want to predictive maintenance and listen to engine/turbine/generator sounds and hunt for anomalous sounds? You may want to denoise and remove artifacts? You may be in a noisy industrial space and you only want to keep the engine sounds and separate the ambient noise? e.g. /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/foundationPLR/background-research/older-archives/wearableMic_signal-compressed.md for wearable lung sounds monitoring in which you would like to do blind signal separation of lung, heart and artifact sounds? Maybe you even can have multiple sensors helping you in that task so that you would not operate so blindly? And what other field, especially outside biomedical research, can you think of when there were would be event-related univariate time series, in which you would benefit from this type of anomaly detection and signal reconstruction? Monitoring for some industrial processes? Monitoring of airplane, submarine, car? Do some deep exploration of this and let's try to come up with some translational figures on how the TSFM, and especially this repo could serve as a seed for other domains as well and highlight that in the end, what we did here was just using PLR data, with the code not being so domain-specific!
